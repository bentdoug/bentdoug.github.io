## Portfolio

### CS-174

#### Drawing With Recursion
![Sierpiński triangle](https://github.com/bentdoug/bentdoug.github.io/blob/main/CS-174%20Portfolio/recursivedrawingresult.png?raw=true)

Using recursion and a simple program that creates shapes in a bitmap, I was able to recreate the Sierpiński triangle in just six lines of code.

#### Synonym and Vowel Filtering in Audio
[Filtered Audio](https://ursinuscollege365-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/bedouglas_ursinus_edu/EUH6Z2ezxpxDtfLvKHxxVsIBwdLqeRDJd8hZigiODFY7eg?e=3YjH2l)

Utalizing pointers, arrays, and loops in c++, I was able to implement a "filtering" method which was able to filter out synonyms or vowels from an audio clip. An example of the filtered audio can be found above.

#### Using Threads to Efficiently Detect Roads
![Processed Road](https://github.com/bentdoug/bentdoug.github.io/blob/main/CS-174%20Portfolio/RoadDetection-Threads/edges.png?raw=true)

Times before Threads and Syncronization - 

Run 1 - BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 14 seconds)

Run 2 - BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 11 seconds)

Run 3 - BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 12 seconds)

Times post Threads and Syncrinization - 

Run 1 - BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 5 seconds)

Run 2 - BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 5 seconds)

Run 3 - BUILD SUCCESSFUL (total time: 4 seconds)


I was able to significantly increase the efficiency and speed up a program that was detecting major angles on a road for possible use in a self driving car scenario.  This was done by "deviding and conquering" using Threads and Syncronization.  Program processing time on average, was made 61% faster.

#### COVID-19 Simulation and Polymorphism
![covid Simulation](https://github.com/bentdoug/bentdoug.github.io/blob/main/CS-174%20Portfolio/covidpolymorphism.gif?raw=true)

This project utalized my knowledge of class declarations, polymorphism, and inheritance in order to create the basic simulation you see above. It shows how COVID-19 can spread throughout a community complete with Nurses (people with the ability to heal others) as well as COVIDiots (people not taking it seriously and traveling without concern for the virus).

#### Duque Utalization, Breadth-First Algorithm, and Forest Fire Simulations
![forest Fire](https://github.com/bentdoug/bentdoug.github.io/blob/main/CS-174%20Portfolio/deques_forestFires/dequefiregif.gif?raw=true)

This project communicates the benefits of utalizing the appropriate collection method for algorithm implementation, in this case Breadth-First Search.  Upon creating my own implementation of a Deque, I was able to use this data structure to run a forest fire simulation program which utalized Breadth-First Search to create what is seen above, an example of how forest fires can spread quickly to the trees directly around them.

#### Creating a Virtual City
![Cowville](https://github.com/bentdoug/bentdoug.github.io/blob/main/CS-174%20Portfolio/cowville.PNG?raw=true)

This project served as a way to brush up on my knowledge of methods and how they fit together as well as practicing reading and understanding documentation for pre-existing methods then utalizing those methods for my own work.  This project concluded with the creation of the city scene (complete with cow pedestrians) you can see above.

#### Choose Your Own Adventure
[See Code Here](https://github.com/bentdoug/Choose-Your-Own-Adventure)

This was a fun, open-ended project in which I utalized the HashMap data structure in order to create my own Choose Your Own Adventure story and application.  I was able to create a short murder mystery with steps along the way for the reader to choose their next step which all impacted the end result of the plot.
