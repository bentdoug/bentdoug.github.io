### Overview

I am studying Computer Science, Theater Technology and Design, as well as Economics at Ursinus College. I am passionate about my fields of study and enjoy tirelessly working towards a goal and making it a reality. I am interested in finding new ways to implement advances in Computer Science throughout our daily lives, economics, as well as the theatrical industry.

I posses skills in Computer Science (C++, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Java), have hands on experience in theatrical technology and production, and am an avid cyclist with customer service experience as a salesman and mechanic in the cycling industry.
