## About Me!

![About Me Photos](https://github.com/bentdoug/bentdoug.github.io/blob/main/photos/aboutmephotos.png?raw=true)

Hello!  I'm Benjamin Douglas, but you can call me Ben.  I am a Computer Science, Theater Technology and Design, and Economics student from New Jersey.  I am passionate about my fields of study and enjoy tirelessly working towards a goal and making it a reality. I am interested in finding new ways to implement advances in Computer Science throughout our daily lives, economics, as well as the theatrical industry.

I posses skills in Computer Science (C++, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Java), have hands on experience in theatrical technology and production, and am an avid cyclist with customer service experience as a salesman and mechanic in the cycling industry. I love to spend my free time outdoors.  I can commonly be found cycling, camping, or photographing my surroundings.
