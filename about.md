Hello!  I'm Benjamin Douglas, but you can call me Ben.  I am a Computer Science, Theater Technology and Design, and Economics student from New Jersey.  I am passionate about my fields of study and enjoy tirelessly working towards a goal and making it a reality.

I posses skills in Computer Science (C++, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and Java), have hands on experience in theatrical technology and production, and am an avid cyclist with customer service experience as a salesman and mechanic in the cycling industry.
